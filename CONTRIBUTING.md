# Contributing to Munch the Rainbow

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project exists to help people build a healthier relationship with food tracking, and every contribution should keep that mission in mind.

## Core Principles

Before contributing, please understand the design philosophy:

1. **Balance over numbers** — The default experience should always be number-free
2. **Encouragement over judgment** — No scores, grades, streaks, or negative feedback
3. **Privacy first** — All data stays on the user's device
4. **Accessibility** — The app should work for everyone

## What We Will Not Merge

- Features that display calorie counts in the default view
- Scoring systems, grades, or pass/fail judgments on meals or days
- "Streak" mechanics that create guilt around missed days
- Red/green color coding that implies good/bad food choices
- Weight tracking or body measurement features
- Social comparison features

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
4. Make your changes on a feature branch
5. Test on mobile viewport sizes (this is a mobile-first app)
6. Submit a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why

## Code Style

- TypeScript for all new files
- Functional React components with hooks
- Inline styles (matching the existing pattern) or Tailwind utilities
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments for non-obvious logic
